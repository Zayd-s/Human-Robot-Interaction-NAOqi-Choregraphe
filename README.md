# Human Robot interaction project, Social robots in education to help children (GM_12)

The following applications were made using Choregraphe; Softbank's desktop application for programming and using the NAO robot. The information gives a brief overview of the learning targets with each application file:

basic_speech_and_movement - This application is not complex, however indicates the use possibilities of NAO's speech and movement, and how they can be combined to produce different applications for learning.

count_fingers_timeline - Here is an example of using NAO's motors to make specific movements. In this example, I wanted to produce an application of NAO counting his fingers with the student. However, this is only doable with a real life version of NAO.

Python_dialogue 1 and 2 - This application shows examples of python scripting with NAO, and how python is used to programme NAO's functions, targeted towards education for children.

Speech_recognition - A display of speech recognition to show the communication and learning possibilities with NAO.

SpeechRecog_MathsEnglish_QiChat - Using Qichat scripting, here is an application to suggest learning techniques for children with NAO, using Choregraphe's built in QiChat programming method.
